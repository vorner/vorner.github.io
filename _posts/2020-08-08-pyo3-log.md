# Announcing pyo3-log

It's been a while since I published the [library][pyo3-log] and haven't had the
time to write something about it until now, but better late than never.

## About pyo3

The [pyo3] is quite a nice library to help interoperate between Python and Rust.
There are multiple similar libraries, but personally I find this one to have the
most convenient API ‒ most of its „magic“ happens by procedural macros in form
of function attributes in combination with some clever types (like the
[`Python`] token that represents both the interpreter and its Global Interpreter
Lock).

Recently the library started to work on stable Rust (previously it required
nightly) so I've decided to give it a closer look and experiment with it a bit.

## Writing a full-featured Python module in Rust

When playing with it, I've noticed the module produced by the library doesn't
solve just the bare minimum of a module, exporting some classes and functions.
It allows one to do the more advanced things (easily making objects
bool or string convertible, creating iterators or context managers). It even
gives one the built-in `help(module)` and `help(Class)` documentation, by
reusing the ordinary Rust documentation comments. The integration feels *almost*
seamless. There are, of course, some details that makes it impossible to just
write a fully idiomatic Rust code, stamp an attribute on the function and be
done with it, like the GIL or that some types don't know how to convert to their
counterpart in Python, but it's not the gruesome juggling with C APIs and
structs to do what needs to be done.

What is missing, then, to be able to write a really nice and Python-looking
module with just small amount of work?

## Logging

When writing Rust code, you may be used to spreading logging statements through
it. Or you might use a dependency that logs itself. But when you wrap it up into
a Python module, where do the messages go? Well, by default, nowhere. They
disappear.

The [log] library is just a facade. It allows one to produce the messages, but
needs a back-end to send the messages somewhere. Usually, such back-end is
global for the whole application. However, due to technical details, the global
means the one Rust module in here ‒ if there are two distinct Rust modules
loaded to one Python program, they have independent back-ends (I haven't tried
what happens in the reverse scenario where the top level application is in Rust
and loads some Python, or when that python loads some more Rust). So as the
author of the module, you can decide to simply send the messages where ever you
like, for example by using [env-logger] or [fern].

And then, of course, the Python side of the application will also have its own
logging and will log somewhere. If you're the owner of both, then you probably
can make all instances of Rust modules and the Python logging system produce
same-looking messages to the same place.

But it's not exactly the right way to do it. Furthermore, if you decide to
provide the module to some third party (publish it, or just provide it to a
different department in your company), this is not the expected behaviour and it
doesn't really look like a well-behaved Python module. One expects the log
messages to go through the logging system of the top-level application, which,
in this case, would be the Python logging system.

## Meet the pyo3-logging bridge

So I'm finally getting to the point. The [pyo3-log] crate is not a module in the
Python sense, it can't be used directly from that world. Instead it provides the
[Log] (the back-end) for Rust's [log] library. When logging a message, it'd
call into the Python and hand the message over to its [logging] library.

Of course, it's not that simple. The smaller detail is that Python doesn't have
the `trace` log level. It does, however, allow specifying log levels as integers
so the library simply extrapolates and uses the next integer. The calling
application can add a name for it.

The other one is performance. Once a message is to be logged, it can't be really
helped, one must go to the Python. But there's usually going to be huge number
of trace and debug messages that won't get logged and these don't in principle
have to go to Python.

Considering Rust is likely going to be used because of performance (compiled
language, no garbage collector, better parallelism due to no GIL in Rust code),
interspersing the fast Rust code with calls to comparatively slower Python might
be a problem. Furthermore, the long-running or parallel Rust code would likely
be running without GIL, allowing the other Python threads to run in parallel
with it. But every time a trace statement appears in the code, it would have to
lock the GIL (wait its turn to get it), call into Python to find out that no,
the message doesn't have to be logged, like all the ones before that. That
doesn't sound very fast and it could discourage the programmer from proper
logging.

This is the reason why the library offers [caching] of the decisions. The idea
is that Rust calls into Python only the first time a message of a particular
level and target is logged. If Python is configured not to log it, the next
message with the same target and level is simply thrown away without all the
hassle of acquiring GIL, blocking other threads and such.

The downside is, it is possible to change the configuration of the Python
logging at runtime (or simply after the module has already logged something
during the initialization). These changes would not be reflected. Therefore,
there's an option not to use the cache and there's a function to wipe the cache
and start over.

## Try it out

The use case is a bit niche, but if you're in a position where it might be
useful, please try it out and report any issues or suggestions to the
[repository]. While it is a release with low version number, I feel like it is
mostly feature complete.  There's not much that could be added; there's one TODO
about key-value pairs but it is unstable feature of [log], so I'm waiting it
out.

I do plan to release new version whenever a breaking release of [pyo3] happens,
to keep up with it.

I'm not going to put examples here, but there's enough of them in the
[documentation] and the [repository] itself.
